This project MUST be exported into a jar and included in your .war's lib for containers to properly load up the tlds 
(at least, it does for WebLogic 12.1.3 and Tomcat 8.0).

Note that WebLogic 12.1.3 does not load the tld for the tag file (but does load the other tlds).  
Tomcat 8.0 does not have that problem.

This project contains a classic tag, several simple tags, and a tag file.

This project is currently configured as a WebLogic project, you'll need to remove that and add your container's 
runtime instead.

A reminder: if you use Tomcat, you'll need to download and include the JSTL library in your .war's lib as well.
