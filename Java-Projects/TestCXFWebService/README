Web Service generated/deployed with Apache CXF

The Eclipse 'wizard' to generate a service via CXF did not initially fill in the contents of the cxf-beans.xml (or I did something wrong), 
had to populate the spring bean entry with the @WebService pojo and the jaxws:endpoint entry.
For the second Web Service I generated, it *did* fill in cxf-beans.xml for me.

Note that CXF appends a / onto the namespace (while Axis does not):
    CXF: http://service.test.pst.com/
    Axis: http://service.test.pst.com
