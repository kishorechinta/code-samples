This ear contains 
	TestWebProject
	TestWebProject1

The entire purpose of these two projects is to demonstrate that one web app can fetch the attributes of another web app's context.

To demonstrate, hit /TestWebProject/tillery and notice the 'Howdy! null' message. 
Then hit /TestWebProject1/newtillery. 
Then hit /TestWebProject/tillery and notice the null is gone - the other app set an attribute the first app fetched.
