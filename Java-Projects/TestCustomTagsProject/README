This project contains a 'test harness' for the tags in the TestCustomTagsJarProject.  You must jar that project up and 
include it in the lib folder of this .war for it to work.  To test, request the URL /TestCustomTagsProject/customTagTester (the 
servlet sets up the test data).

This project also contains a couple of test jsps that output all the implicit JSP and EL objects - request the url
/TestCustomTagsProject/objectCheckerRedirect.jsp to test this out.

Note the jsps in this project are in the JSP Document format (as in: well-formed XML documents).
