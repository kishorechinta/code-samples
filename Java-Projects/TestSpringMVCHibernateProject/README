This project requires a lot of setup.
It is currently configured for WebLogic, you'll need to change that to your container.
It is also set up to hit Oracle DB, you'll need to change that to your DB.  You'll also 
need to create the schema and tables (just two tables).

This project is a Spring MVC + Hibernate example.  JQuery is used in the UI to make Ajax 
calls.  The UI allows for CRUD operations on a person table in the DB.

Also included is a Spring Controller used to test Spring Transaction Management and JAXB 
Threading.  This Spring Controller is named JAXBThreadSafetyController.  
To test the TX, try this curl:
	while(true) ; do curl http://localhost:7001/TestSpringMVCHibernateProject/spring/jaxb-thread/tx ; done;
To test the JAXB threading, try this (tweak the code to remove the ThreadLocal and just 
use a SchemaFactory instance variable):
	while(true) ; do curl http://localhost:7001/TestSpringMVCHibernateProject/spring/jaxb-thread/safe ; done;

This is a Maven project so your version of Eclipse must have that capability (this was 
made with Eclipse Luna).  Look at the pom and grab those jars (or replace them with comparable 
jars) as needed.  You'll need Maven set up on your box.

This war is not associated with an .ear, so if your container requires that (doesn't create 
a default for you), you'll need to create one.

Also included is a Jersey REST implemenation, after deploying run this:
	curl http://localhost:7001/TestSpringMVCHibernateProject/rest/application.wadl
to fetch WADL for the entire resource, or try
    curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:7001/TestSpringMVCHibernateProject/rest/wadlServlet/getWADL
    curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:7001/TestSpringMVCHibernateProject/rest/wadlServlet/postWADL
to fetch WADL for a specific operation.

$ curl http://localhost:7001/TestSpringMVCHibernateProject/rest/application.wadl
