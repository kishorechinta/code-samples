This project requires a lot of setup.
It is currently configured for WebLogic, you'll need to change that to your container.
It is also set up to hit Oracle DB, you'll need to change that to your DB.  You'll also need to create the schema and tables (just two tables).

This project is a Spring MVC + Hibernate example.  JQuery is used in the UI to make Ajax calls.  The UI allows for CRUD operations 
on a person table in the DB.

This is a Maven project so your version of Eclipse must have that capability (this was made with Eclipse Luna).  Look at the pom and grab those
jars (or replace them with comparable jars) as needed.  You'll need Maven set up on your box.

This war is not associated with an .ear, so if your container requires that (doesn't create a default for you), you'll need to create one.
