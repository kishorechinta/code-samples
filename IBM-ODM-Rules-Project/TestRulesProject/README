
I do not recommend attempting to import this project into Eclipse - it was created with Rules Designer IDE, a specific 
'flavor' of Eclipse; I recommend just checking out the code 'manually.'  Unfortunately that means missing out on the pretty
Rules Designer GUIs, sorry.  I did include a screenshot of how the main rule flow (HealthCheckRuleFlow) appears in the Rules 
Designer IDE.

There are 3 rule flows in this project.  

The main rule is HealthCheckRuleFlow.  
It does not contain any action rules or technical rules; only action tasks - therefore
the only 'code' required to make it work is the ruleflow itself, the bom (defines the java objects) and the domain (the java objects, in
the TestDomain project).  
The TestRules-DVS-Runner.xlsx was generated by the Rules Designer IDE; but the rows (the tests and expected results) are filled in
by the developer.  It is run by the Rules Designer IDE (run as 'DVS Excel File') and the TestRulesProject-DVS-Report.html 
is generated with the results.

The other two rule flows are executed by the Rules Designer IDE (run as 'Java Application with Rules', inputs are configured in the
Run Configuration) but they each must be set as the main rule flow first (Properties tab of each file - this is also Rules Designer IDE
specific).
These two rule flows no longer 'work' (due to changes in the domain POJOs) but provide examples of Action Rules, BAL and IRL.
